## Description

A game built to test your group's teamwork skills. Beat the bots through testing and communication!

Each bot has a weakness (some sort of predictability), deduce the rule and beat them 5 times in a row to unlock the next bot!

This project was built to test our team's ability to write and implement complex code into a react application. This game was inspired by the "guess my rule" game (sometimes used in summer camps) where one individual comes up with a rule, and conducts their interactions with the group based off of their rule. Our project follows this same basic principle. Each bot will have a rule that dictates their actions against the user.

The purpose of this application is to push your team to communicate and use teamwork to beat the game. It can be used as an ice-breaker or team-builder for class cohorts or business teams.
