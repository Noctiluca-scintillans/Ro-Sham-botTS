## Description
A game built to test your group's teamwork skills. Beat the bots through testing and communication! 
Each bot has a rule their madness, decode the rule and beat them 5 times in a row to unlock the next bot!

This project was built to test our team's ability to write and implement complex code into a react application. This game was inspired by simple team building games that are often used in summer camps. The particular game that inspired the idea is a game in which one individual comes up with a rule, and will conduct their interactions with the group based off of their rule. Our project follows this same basic principle. Each bot will have a rule that dictates their actions against the user.

The purpose of this application is to push your team to communicate and use teamwork to beat the game.
